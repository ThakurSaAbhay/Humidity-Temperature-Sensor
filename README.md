# Humidity-Temperature-Sensor
Itâ€™s an IOT based project. 
I've used an ESP board which gives a server when connected to Wi-Fi and DHT sensor which updates humidity and temperature data, 
coded a website using CSS and HTML uploaded it in the ESP board using Arduino and C++.
When we connect the device and ESP board to the same wifi the website can be seen on the IP of ESP board.
